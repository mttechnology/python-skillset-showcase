# Python Skillset Showcase üêç

This repository presents a collection of Python mini-projects demonstrating my core skills as a Python developer. It is structured to showcase clean code, problem-solving ability, and practical use of Python features.


## üéØ Goals?

-‚úîÔ∏è Demonstrate proficiency in Python programming
-‚úîÔ∏è Organize sample projects in a scalable, readable structure
-‚úîÔ∏è Serve as a living portfolio for job applications and professional networking


## üìÇ Project Structure

Each project is organized in its own directory and includes:
- One or more Jupyter notebooks containing source code that addresses the same topic using different approaches
- A project-specific `README.md` explaining the task, logic, and outcomes
- A `requirements.txt` if external packages are used


## Included Projects
| Project Name          | Description                                                                                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01-currency-converter | Basic currency conversion logic with input/output handling                                   |
| 02-transactions       | Calculates account balances from banking transactions data                                   |
| 03-find-long-words    | Two Jupyter notebooks demonstrating different methods to find words exceeding a specified length in a text ‚Äî one using set comprehension, and the other using a closure with filter() to extract words |



## How This Helps You Evaluate Me

Each project is built to reflect:
- Modular and readable code structure
- Practical understanding of Python data types and control flow
- Real-world inspired problem solving
