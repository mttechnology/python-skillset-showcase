# Project: Currency Converter

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple currency conversion logic using hardcoded data. A list of tuples contains multiple exchange scenarios with an amount, source currency, target currency, and exchange rate. The program loops through the list and prints the converted value for each item. It is designed to showcase basic Python skills such as tuple unpacking, loops, and formatted output.

## Features
- Processes a list of predefined currency conversion records.
- Uses tuple unpacking to extract amount, source currency, target currency, and exchange rate.
- Computes converted values with a simple multiplication (amount Ã— exchange_rate).
- Prints clean, human-readable conversion results using f-strings.
- Easy to extend: just add more (amount, source, target, rate) tuples to the data list.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Tuple unpacking in `for` loops.
- Iterating over lists of data structures.
- Performing simple arithmetic operations.
- Using f-strings for formatted and readable output.


## Dependencies
No external dependencies. Runs in standard Python environment with Jupyter.

## How to Run
Open the notebook `01_currency_converter.ipynb` and run each cell sequentially.
